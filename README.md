## 🧠 Recommended Tools

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) – for faster searching

## 💡 Notes

- Run `:checkhealth` in Neovim to troubleshoot common issues.
- You can extend or override parts of the config by editing `init.lua` or the `lua/` directory.
- This setup is intentionally minimal — feel free to fork and customize as needed.
